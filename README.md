# OpenSearch-k8s-operator
The Kubernetes OpenSearch Operator is used for automating the deployment, provisioning, management, and orchestration of OpenSearch clusters and OpenSearch dashboards.

# Roadmap
The project is currently a work in progress and is not (yet) recommended for use in non-test environments. The plan is to reach General Availability and a fully functioning Operator by end of 22-Q1.

## The Operator features:
- [x] Deploy a new OS cluster.
- [x] Ability to deploy multiple clusters.
- [x] Spin up OS dashboards.
- [ ] Operator Monitoring, with Prometheus and Grafana.
- [x] Configuration of all node roles (master, data, coordinating..).
- [x] Scale the cluster resources (manually), per nodes' role group. 
- [x] Drain strategy for scale down.
- [ ] Cluster configurations and nodes' settings updates.
- [ ] Rolling restarts - through API.
- [ ] Version updates.
- [ ] Scaling nodes' disks - increase/replace disks.
- [ ] Change nodes' memory allocation and limits.
- [ ] Control shard balancing and allocation.
- [ ] Advanced allocation strategies: AZ/Rack awareness, Hot/Warm.
- [x] Secured installation features.
- [ ] Auto scaler based on usage, load, and resources.

# Getting Started
## Installing the Operator

- Clone the repo
- Run `make build manifests` to build the controller binary and the manifests
- Start a kubernetes cluster (e.g. with k3d or minikube) and make sure your `~/.kube/config` points to it
- Run `make install` to create the CRD in the kubernetes cluster

## Deploying a new OpenSearch cluster

Go to `opensearch-operator` and use `opensearch-cluster.yaml` as a starting point to define your cluster - note that the `clusterName` is also the namespace that the new cluster will reside in. Then run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f opensearch-cluster.yaml
```

Note: the current installation deploys with the default demo certificate provided by OpenSearch.

## Deleting an OpenSearch cluster

In order to delete the cluster, please delete your OpenSearch cluster resource; this will delete the cluster namespace and all its resources.

```bash
kubectl get opensearchclusters --all-namespaces
kubectl delete opensearchclusters my-cluster -n <namespace>
```
